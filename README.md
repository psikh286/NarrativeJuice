# Parkour DEMO (University Project)

## Description
This game was created as part of the Narrative Juice course at the University of Europe for Applied Sciences. This project was my first experience with Unreal Engine and Blueprints. We built a basic parkour movement demo with features like wall running, sliding, air dash, and more. The <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/advanced-locomotion-system-v1" target="_blank">ALSv4 package</a> served as the core of our movement system.
